Project Type    : Mini Project - C Programming
Submission Date : October 30, 2025

================================================================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------
A command-line interface (CLI) based event management system that allows users
to create, manage, search, and delete events with automatic reminders. The
application uses a singly linked list data structure for efficient event
management and binary file storage for data persistence. All events are
displayed in chronological order (sorted by date).

================================================================================

FEATURES
--------
1.  Add Events         - Create new events with auto-generated unique IDs
2.  View All Events    - Display all events sorted chronologically by date
3.  Find Events        - Search events by specific date
4.  Delete Events      - Remove events using unique Event ID
5.  Monthly Calendar   - Display calendar with events overlay for any month/year
6.  Upcoming Reminders - Show events within next N days with countdown
7.  Save to File       - Manually save all events to binary file
8.  Auto-Load          - Automatically loads previous events on startup
9.  Data Persistence   - Events stored in binary format survive program restart
10. Input Validation   - Validates dates, prevents buffer overflow issues

================================================================================

TECHNICAL DETAILS
-----------------

1. DATA STRUCTURE:
   - Singly Linked List for dynamic event storage
   - Each node contains full event details
   - O(n) insertion at end, O(1) for head insertion

2. MEMORY MANAGEMENT:
   - Dynamic memory allocation using calloc()
   - Proper memory deallocation using free()
   - No memory leaks (all allocated memory is freed)
   - FreeAllEvents() function ensures cleanup

3. FILE HANDLING:
   - Binary file format for efficient storage
   - Functions: fopen(), fread(), fwrite(), fclose()
   - File name: "eventdata" (stored in same directory)
   - Auto-load on program start

4. EVENT ID GENERATION:
   - Format: EV + 8 random alphanumeric characters
   - Example: EVAC7K2M9X, EVD6YBYAOC, EVXR3T8N4P
   - Uses time-based seed for randomization
   - Duplicate check mechanism included

5. SORTING ALGORITHM:
   - Bubble sort on array of event pointers
   - Sorted by Year → Month → Day (chronological)
   - Time complexity: O(n²)
   - Only used for display, doesn't modify linked list

6. DATE VALIDATION:
   - Day: 1-31
   - Month: 1-12
   - Year: >= 1900
   - Automatic leap year handling in calendar display

7. INPUT BUFFER HANDLING:
   - Buffer flushing after time input to prevent skip
   - Prevents issues when entering time with spaces
   - getchar() used strategically to clear newlines

================================================================================
MAKEFILE COMMANDS
-----------------
make          - Build the project (compile all files)
make all      - Same as 'make'
make run      - Build and run the program
make clean    - Remove object files, executable, and data file
make rebuild  - Clean and build from scratch

================================================================================

BUILD OUTPUT
------------
Expected output when running 'make':

$ make
gcc -Wall -Wextra -c eventmain.c
gcc -Wall -Wextra -c eventcode.c
gcc -Wall -Wextra -c calendar.c
gcc -Wall -Wextra -o eventCalendar eventmain.o eventcode.o calendar.o
=========================================
Build complete! Run with ./eventCalendar
=========================================

This indicates:
✓ Zero compilation errors
✓ Zero warnings
✓ Professional code quality
✓ Ready to run

================================================================================

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

Problem: "make: command not found"
Solution: Install make utility
          Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install build-essential
          macOS: xcode-select --install

Problem: "Permission denied" when running ./eventCalendar
Solution: Make file executable
          $ chmod +x eventCalendar

Problem: Events not loading on restart
Solution: Ensure 'eventdata' file exists in same directory
          Save events before exiting (option 's' or save on quit)

Problem: Compilation errors about missing headers
Solution: Ensure all files are in same directory:
          eventmain.c, eventcode.c, eventheader.h
          calendar.c, calendarheader.h, Makefile

Problem: Description input skipped when entering time
Solution: This is fixed with buffer flushing mechanism
          Rebuild with: make rebuild

Problem: Duplicate Event IDs (extremely rare)
Solution: Event IDs use time-based seed - restart program

================================================================================

KNOWN LIMITATIONS
-----------------
1. Maximum 100+ events can be displayed at once (array size in ViewAllEvents)
2. Event ID is fixed at 10 characters (EV + 8 random chars)
3. Time format restricted to 5 characters (HH:MM)
4. Title limited to 100 characters maximum
5. Description limited to 200 characters maximum
6. Binary file format not portable across different architectures
7. No concurrent access protection (single-user application)

================================================================================

FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS
-------------------
1. Search by title/description using string matching
2. Edit existing events (modify date, time, description)
3. Recurring events support (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
4. Color-coded calendar display for better visualization
5. Email/SMS reminder integration
6. Export events to CSV/JSON/iCalendar format
7. Multiple calendar views (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly)
8. Event priority levels (low, medium, high, urgent)
9. Event categories (work, personal, birthday, holiday)
10. Multi-user support with authentication
